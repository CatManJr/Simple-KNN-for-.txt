# Simple KNN for .txt
ch:
使用C++17标准STL库实现简单的KNN算法，使用KD树优化；
输入数据格式为.txt文本，内部格式需要预处理为行内空格隔开的数字字符串；
直接在console中完成运算，根据用户输入的训练样本个数，在同一.txt文本中按顺序划分训练集和推理集
算法实现借鉴了https://blog.csdn.net/seek97/article/details/119206336?spm=1001.2014.3001.5506

The C++17 standard STL library is used to implement a simple KNN algorithm, which is optimized by KD tree. 
The input data format is txt text, and the internal format needs to be preprocessed into a numeric string separated by spaces within the line. 
The operation is completed directly in the console. According to the number of training samples entered by the user, the training set and the inference set are divided in order in the same.txt text.
The algorithm implementation draws on https://blog.csdn.net/seek97/article/details/119206336?spm=1001.2014.3001.5506
